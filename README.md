# ADM-HW5
In this homework, we have built a system that provides users with information about StackOverflow. Specifically, the implementation of the system consists of two parts: backend and frontend.

#### Implementation of the backend
   - Functionality 1 - Get the overall features of the graph
   - Functionality 2 - Find the best users!
   - Functionality 3 - Shortest Ordered Route
   - Functionality 4 - Disconnecting graphs
   
#### Implementation of the fronted
   - Visualization 1 - Visualize the overall features of the graph
   - Visualization 2 - Visualize the best user!
   - Visualization 3 - Visualize the Shortest Ordered Route
   - Visualization 4 - Visualize disconnecting graphs
     


## Content Description
In our repository there is:
- `main.ipynb` is the jupyter notebook where we have runned all the functions implemented to solve the functionalities and the algorithmic question.
- `general_functions.py` is python file where we have written functions to pass from txt file to csv and file and trasform the unix timestamp in a date. 
- `test.py` is python file where we have read the csv file, filtered dataframe with a time interval, assigned the weights, created the graph and written some graph test to check our functions.
- `graphs_functions.py` is a python file where we have written the classes to implement our Graph. 
- `functionality_1.py` is python file where there are the functions needed to implement the first functionality. 
- `functionality_2.py` is python file where there are the functions needed to implement the second functionality.
- `functionality_3.py` is python file where there is the function needed to implement the third functionality.
- `app_function.py` is python file where there are the functions needed to implement the menu of our system.
- `algoquest.py` is python file where there is the function needed to implement the algorithmic question.
