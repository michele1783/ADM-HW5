In this homework, we have built a system that provides users with information about StackOverflow. Specifically, the implementation of the system consists of two parts: backend and frontend.

## Implementation of the backend
   - Functionality 1 - Get the overall features of the graph
   - Functionality 2 - Find the best users!
   - Functionality 3 - Shortest Ordered Route
   - Functionality 4 - Disconnecting graphs
   
## Implementation of the fronted
   - Visualization 1 - Visualize the overall features of the graph
   - Visualization 2 - Visualize the best user!
   - Visualization 3 - Visualize the Shortest Ordered Route
   - Visualization 4 - Visualize disconnecting graphs
